# Koiwai

Koiwai is an image editing program made specifically for manga (or other comic) translation. The program itself does not actually translate anything, but it provides the user with tools to locate speech bubbles, remove text, and export in various formats.

### Status

The program is currently under development, and is not functional. :/
